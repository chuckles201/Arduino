    "## Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we apply a battery across a wire, we will generate a force that 'pushes' the electrons to be in the more positive side of the wire, due to chemical force we described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called an electromagnetic force, and is voltage. Think of voltage as the magnitude of the force, but not the overall potential energy (it could be only a short, high-voltage). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One can imagine voltage, as being determined by the strength of the battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a larger surface area would just cause more potential electrons to be swapped (longer battery life), a higher voltage would be acheived only by choosing more negative/positive/reactive metals. Each electron would experience a stronger 'driving force'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to view the force, is that electric charges get built up at the negative terminal of the battery. These charges then 'push' eachother to the positive side, and cause a chain reaction throughout the wire 'pushing' each other electron to the positive terminal, where they are attracted. Furthermore, it could be imagined that deeper in the circuit, the electrons feel less of a 'push', as there are objects in the way that may repel (somehpow) the original force. A deeper understanding of circuitry, and electromagnetic theory is requiered to understand this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just important to know that voltage is associated with the amount of 'push' the electrons experience, or how 'eager' they are to get to the positive region/away from the negative region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{AB} = \\frac{U_{AB}}{q}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where AB is the difference between points A and B, u is the potential energy, and b is the charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitvely, if we have a very high potential for energy, and a very small amount of charge, the voltage is very large; a few electrons (charges) are making a lot of energy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that usually just 'V' is used; the fact that it is a difference between two points is always implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also note that this voltage formula implies that the energy generated is equal to the voltage times the charge; where if we have 1 amp and 2 volts, we generate 2 j/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a volt as providing enough potential difference to give 1 coloumb of charge one joule of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### voltage drop\n",
    "\n",
    "When energy is used in the circuit (IE 3v for an LED), voltage is used up, and there is less potential energy than before. Furthermore in different parts of the LED, the voltage will be different, and larger depending on how different their potential energies are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this, is that we are using some of the electrons energy up by doing some work, or producing something. Therefore, although our battery terminals will have the same voltage, voltage across the circuit will vary, depending on 'how much' the electron has done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to this as a voltage drop: for example, our conductors have very low voltage-drop since the electrons are not doing any work (ideally), but an LED that takes up a lot of energy, will have a high voltage drop (electrons before the LED have much more energy than the electrons that have 'used it up' going through the LED).\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of the whole thing as having some magnetic/eletric 'driving force' which continually pushes a current, but the amount of voltage, or energy in the electrons is finite, and can be used up while they are being pushed. While in reality it is more complex, this continous flow, and stored energy is a good practical analogy.\n"

    "If we wanted a larger voltage than one battery alone would give, and we had two batteries, we can connect them in series, and their voltage adds. The intuition behind this, is that now getting electrons from each battery want to flow. Note that sometimes we use a refrence 'ground' point as zero volts, this makes reading circuits easier at times, but just remember that always voltages are relative, and current is flowing from one end of a battery to its own other.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is known as ohms law: $1\\Omega = 1V/1A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not necessarily a 'law', but rather a macroscopic property that arises in materials. Some materials don't even obey this law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in wires resistance is proportional to the length (inversly) and the cross-sectional area (more space for electrons to flow). This can partially be explained, because there are less electrons flowing in a thicker wire per unit area, meaning less on-average collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conductivity/Resistivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Reisitivity is defined as $\\rho=R\\frac{A}{L}$ which is the inherent 'resistivness' of a material. Conductivity is simply the inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, metals can follow this law:\n",

    "\\rho=\\rho_{0}\\left[ 1+\\alpha(T-T_{0}) \\right]\n",

    "### What Explains different resistances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different atoms have a different number of valence shells that electrons can lie within. If a given material has a partially empty band, it will much more easily give/take electrons, because it doesn't have to jump a 'gap' to the next levels."

    "Resistors are a special case where current varies linearly with voltage, however with some components, increasing the does not mean a decrease in 'work done' (a lot of volt drop, not a lot of resistivity).

    "## Ground\n",
    "![ground](images/ground.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about ground, and using the above symbol, one can mean either the negative battery-terminal, a refrence 9-voltage point, or the actual *earth's* ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple example is when ground is just the negative terminal of the battery, and we define every other voltage relative to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is when we choose a point to be 0v that has 'negative' voltage relative to it; that would push electrons in the opposite direction. This could be handy if we were monitoring a sinusodial current that when positive and negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Earth-ground\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a true ground would be considered earth, where charges cancel out to be exactly zero. Someone would literally stick a metal rod in earth in order to take high-voltage and drive it into the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is important, is because multiple devices can share a ***common refrence point***, even if they are connected to multiple different power-sources, they can always measure against 0V.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to measure the difference between one device and another, or even if we want to power two devices that are close (and don't want a potential difference, so some charge transfer may accidentally happen), we would benefit from a common ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, for the example when we're measuring something with a different powersupply, sharing a 'common ground' is intuitive. If we are just measuring the raw voltage with no ground, we will get very unstable measurements, because even though both terminals of the other supply may be changing, we don't have acess to this (relative) information, we only have our ground to compare with, and *by definition, voltage is a relative comparison*. Therefore, if we simply plug in the other ground, we get stable voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two measurementsfrom my ESP32, the first with a common ground, the second without:\n",
    "\n",
    "![gd](images/gdmg.png)\n",
    "![gdn](images/gdmng.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, why does having common ground help in other cases, when we're not just measuring? Well, the idea is that if an electrical component fails, having all components connected to a common ground, means that the current will immediately flow to the ground of the earth, with near zero resistance, and it won't have any reason to go through a humans body!\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the ground can either be refrence points between measuring equipments, in order to measure relative amounts, and allow current to flow, and we also have a ground wire that connects into the earth (and back to the electrical component), in order to prevent shock in the case of failure. (it prevents shock, because it acts as very low resistance, and therefore, there will be very low voltage across it, and verys small power, the batteries internal resistance takes it all).\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct wiring, is to connect ground to the negative terminal (electrons flow to earth from here).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different signals for chasis (negative metal frame everything is connected to), and earth ground symbols, however they are often confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise in grounding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would have all parts of a circuit flow back through a common ground. This is usually acheived through having one long thick peice of wire that can carry the sum of all the currents. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to do this, because having multiple grounds can cause errors in voltage-readings at different points, and if we use one ground, we can have one refrence for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analog vs. digital grounds\n",
    " \n",
    "Digital voltages may spike at times, when, for example, the resistance of one component changes (therefore, the resistance across other components will change), while analog circuits can also experience this change in voltage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is common practice to keep the AC/DC grounds 'locally' seperated, and only connect them at one point in the circuit.\n",

    "\n",

This is a good quick rule to calculate values for resistors in a voltage divider circuit.\n",

    "Since V=IR always holds, if we know the current that we want to draw from each resistor in series, and know the voltage that will be across them, we can simply use V=IR for each resistor individually, and things will work out, as the overall-resistance is just derived from this.\n",

    "### Ideal voltage source\n",
    "\n",
    "An *ideal* voltage source would supply any voltage, regardless of the loads resistance. An ideal voltage source would have no internal resistance, and supply constant voltage to any resistance. This is infeasable, because there is some internal resistance in a battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means intuitively, is that we could not draw a lot of current from a battery (low $R_{Load}$), because electrical reactions happen at a certain pace, and eventually will act as a kind of resistor, resisting the amount of voltage, and therefore current, that is supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage can be seen as a series resistor in an unideal source:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{Load}=V_{Total} \\ \\cdot \\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{Source}$ should approach zero in an ideal voltage source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal Currrent source\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an ideal current source is a source that provides a steady amount of current, given different resistances. This means, the terminal voltage will scale up/down as needed, given different resistances.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this as a current source, with the internal, and load resistances in parallel. If the internal reistance is high, then most of the current will flow to the load, no matter what (given the load has a smaller internal resistance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here would be the formula for this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{Load}=I_{Total} \\ \\cdot \\frac{R_{Source}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For any resistance in the load, the internal resistance must be high enough to force all of the charge flow through the load. Furthermore, for the source to be ideal, it must adapt to a changing $R_{Load}$ by increasing the voltage, and therefore providing the same amount of current.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *approximation* of an ideal current source would be a *very* large voltage source, in series with a very large resistor. For any smaller load resistance, the current would barely change, but the voltage would scale up. This is because while ohms law 'gives' it twice the voltage for it's resistance, the current barely changes, as it is mostly dictated by the larger resistor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, batteries are modeled as voltage sources, because more or less, batteries have a small internal resistance, and supply a relatively constant voltage, with varying current (although this breaks down at large currents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal current sources mostly just serve as usefull models; what if our current was constant and didn't change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we can see for a real (non-ideal) voltage sources, how more current (less resistance) results in a breakdown, while for the non-ideal current source, more voltage (and therefore resistance) results in the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is important to note, that any battery/voltage supply can be modeled as both an ideal current and voltage source, we just change it into a parallel circuit. This works, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "![currentvvoltage](images/currentvvoltagesource.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The common theme is that for a high voltage, and high power, real sources break down, as they have physical limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, *real voltage sources* like batteries have some internal resistance, and therefore for a large enough current, most voltage will be used in the internal resistance (acts like a resistor in series). While *real current sources* cannot provide steady current for high resistances, as this would require more power and voltage. We can model non-ideal voltage sources with resistors in series (limiting internal resistance), and current sources with resistors in parallel (limiting max. current).\\\n",
    "\n",
    "We use these to try to understand the behaviour of batteries and current supplies in their ***operating*** ranges. It is important to understand however, that no source is ideal, and the conditions which make it less ideal (more current for a non-ideal voltage source).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translating between\n",
    "\n",
    "One last sidenote, is that any source with internal resistance can be expressed as an  current or voltage source.\n",
    "\n",
    "We basically can use this same series model, and say that something with high internal resistance and a low relative $R_{Load}$ is close to an ideal current source, while an ideal voltage source is more like a battery, with low internal resistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be confused by the parallel current example, it is basically showing given that we have a current that we can fix by approximating an ideal current source, we can model it in parallalel, and calculate how much is 'stolen' by the internal resistance based on how much larger the internal resistance is compared to $R_{Load}$. For example, if we had a resistor in series with 1m V and 1M $\\Omega$, given a load resistance of 100k, we wouldn't be too much of an ideal current source (100k is a good proportion of overall reistance).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this can be modeled by the parallel example, we wanted 1 Amp ideally, we added a 10% resistance, so we only get one amp (in the series perspective) $R_{Total} = R_{s}+R_{Load}$ so we have 1/1.1 amps flowing. From the parallel perspective, we had one amp, but some of that is not flowing to the load: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{Load}=I_{Total} \\ \\cdot \\frac{R_{Source}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so therefore, we have the same result, 1/1.1 amps flowing to the load! I think this is pretty cool, that with these very different interpretations, we can get the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of this as the parallel example showing how much ideal voltage is 'stolen' by a lack of large internal resistance (current flow inversly proportional to amount of resistance). The loads resistance in the series example contributes to the overall resistance by $\\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{Total}}$, while the current in the parallel example is proportional to $\\frac{R_{Total}}{R_{Load}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key mathematical formula linking them, is that for the series model, we have the current being influenced by the load proportional to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{s}+R_{Load}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "while in the series example, the amount of current flowing away is also:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{s}+R_{Load}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "this is the key intuition behind why both models can be used: the series show how much current is 'removed' by the loads resistance, while the parallel shows the same amount; but models it as internal resistance!\n",
    "\n",
    "Both examples mean the same thing for an ideal current source and voltage sources, and in practice they are used as simplifications for complex behaving, non-linear supplies of voltage, or current. Looking at a battery as an ideal voltage source is much easier than modeling the internal resistance (at least around appropriate operating ranges!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting example of a practical current source, is a circuit using transistors and rresistors. I don't understand how this works yet, but will get back to it!"

    "## Measuring Voltage/Current/Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about how we measure volts, amps, and ohms in a circuit, and the limitations we have vs. the ideal scenario in measuring them. In theory, a voltmeter should be able to measure voltage without drawing any current; it would be in parallel with $\\infty$ resistance. An ammeter should have 0 resistance, and just measure the current flowing through a circuit at a point, not changing the voltage or resistance at all. An ohmeter should have zero resistance as well, just injecting voltage at a point, and seeing how fast it comes back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multimeters & The Galvanometer\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly the ideal case is impossible, but how are voltmeters/ammeters/ohmeters designed to make good measurements? Well, the most common way to measure voltage/ohms/amps all in one device is the multimeter. \n",

    "At the core of old multimeters were galvanamoters, which converted current into a reading.\n",

    "#### Electromagnetism\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind electromagnetism, is that when particles are moving, according the special relativity, as charges move, their fields are 'squished'. We call the arising force 'magnetism', and it is essentially another electric force that arrises due to moving charges and their fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get more into depth in this later, but just understand that moving charges creates an imbalance in the adjacent fields creating an 'electromagnet', or a force we call magnetism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Galvanometers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can apply principle of electormagnetism, and exploit a current running through a wire, to move a needle that will indicate the extent of a reading/measurement. Understand that we can run a current through a coil and create a north/south electromagnet. We can exploit this to read different magnetic intensities (current intensities) in the following way:\n",

    "if we create a strong enough current, the magnet opposes the coil and creates enough torque to move the indicator. The galvanometer requires very little current (hence, a weaker coil).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we connect a voltage source (in parallel as a voltmeter) to the galvanometer, and add a very large series resistor, we have the ability to have a large internal resistance, while measuring the relative voltage! (more current through resistor means approximately more volts $V=IR$).\n",

    "## Combining Batteries\n",
    "\n",
    "When we combine batteries in parallel, we get an increase in charge (n times more for n batteries), while in series, they add voltage. In series, we can think of the batteries' electrochemical force simply adding; both of the batteries now want electrons, which will push each electron harder, adding the force that each of the battery would supply. Each electron would not only allow one of the battery parts to ionize, but now both, hence the additive force per electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in parallel, each electron is only returning to one battery, and therefore the individual batteries output less current (but the same together), but the voltage stays the same. The intuition behind this, is that when the positive terminal is connected to the other positive terminal, the electrons are not actually experiencing more force, since each electron can only supply power to one battery. Furthermore, only 1/n of charges in each battery experience the force with *n* batteries in parallel, because the voltage is constant due to this.\n",

For example, when LED's in series take up the same amount of voltage (very nonlinear resistance with voltage). In this case, we turn to kirkhoffs laws which are pretty self evident and intuitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Voltage across circuit must be used! (IE if electrons start out with a given voltage, they will use it throughout the circuit at some point, be it a resistor or not), we can see this simply through V=IR, how when resistance changes, and there are multiple resistors, voltage is still all used. This makes sense, because energy is realased (and used) *no matter what* when batteries are able to transition to a more stable state.\n",
    "2. Current entering a junction = exiting. Similarly, when current is flowing into a point, or out of a point, it must add up. This is because of the electromotive forces pushing current through are constant, and different paths do not change this force/amount. Current will never 'stop' or disapear once it's driven by a force (it will only part in different direction!)\n",

    "The reason this is true, is that for a closed loop we basically have electrons that can go in two directions (with same voltage). No matter how complicated the circuit, the electrons will end up using the same amount of energy before they 'meet up' at the next point, or finish this loop.\n",

The other sources do not affect the resistances, they scale at the same rate (linear) no matter what.\n",

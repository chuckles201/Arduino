# Questions I have

If it's all just fields, how do series/parallel distinguish??

How is the chemistry understood at most basic level to convert chemicals/light/anything to voltage????


How is current flowing through two things done?


? How can we go from simple circuits to computers???


? How do we drive high power/current circuits with low-power boards?? (IE motors with ESP!)?

= Transistors to take small voltage and amplify!

    "\n",
    "Motors require a certain voltage, and if the voltage is too low, it will turn slowly and eventually seize to turn; if it is too high, it will burn out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motors have internal resistance (once they are running), proportional to how fast they are spinning (counter magnetic-field), so when there is a load against the motor, it'll spin slower.\n",

    "### Back EMF\n",
    "\n",
    "The work that is done against the magnetic fields inside the motor is called back-EMF. This is not a problem when we are powering the motor, since we are supplying the voltage it's using; but when powering down, it will continue to have some velocity, and therefore generate 'back EMF', a force caused by work done against magnetic fields, that generates current."

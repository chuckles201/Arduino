## Learning Through implementation of simple circuits and arduino!


> ## Goals:
>
> - Find interesting projects to work on to understand science of circuitry and hardware
> - Understanding  of hardware/basics and what is actually going-on through implementation- how is arduino sending these commands on a chemical level?
> - Understanding circuitry basics; voltage/resistance, etc. (already have some background from highschool)
